The Helmet Detection System is a computer vision-based safety monitoring application that detects whether a person is wearing a helmet or not using deep learning.

The model is trained using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and deployed through a Streamlit web application for real-time image-based prediction.

This system can be used in:

-Traffic monitoring systems

-Smart city surveillance

-Industrial safety monitoring

-Construction site safety enforcement
